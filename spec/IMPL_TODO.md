# FlyonUI-Gomponents Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for `gomponents-flyonui`, an isomorphic Go component library that provides FlyonUI components for both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and WebAssembly (WASM) environments. The implementation follows strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology throughout.

## Core Architecture Principles

- **Isomorphic Design**: Components work in both SSR and WASM environments
- **Separation of Concerns**: Static HTML generation (gomponents) vs. interactive behavior (WASM hydration)
- **Type Safety**: Fluent builder pattern with type-safe modifiers
- **TDD First**: No code without tests - unit tests for markup, browser tests for interactivity
- **Performance**: Fine-grained reactivity and minimal JavaScript footprint
